pnpm dev:web    # Start TanStack Start dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm dev:db     # Start Convex dev environment
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start both web and Convex dev servers
pnpm dev:web          # Start TanStack Start dev server only
pnpm dev:db           # Start Convex dev environment only

# Build & Deploy
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking

pnpm shadcn           # Add shadcn/ui components
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Server-Side Auth with TanStack Start

Server-side auth is still a work in progress with TanStack Start, but it is a focus area. **Important**: You'll want to not throw on unauth from queries that run server-side.

In a Convex function, developers often check for auth and throw if the user isn't authenticated. This is normally fine, but auth with TanStack Start can be initially unauthenticated, even with an authenticated user. If you throw, everything errors out.

**Solution**: Return some sort of empty value instead from your Convex function in case the first authenticated call doesn't work.
